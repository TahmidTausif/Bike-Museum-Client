A modern web application for showcasing various types of bikes. Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** on the frontend, and **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** on the backend.

> 📌 **Note**: This project is a customized version of a group project I previously contributed to. I cloned the original repository and redesigned the layout and styling to reflect a more modern and minimal design while maintaining the core functionality.

## 🧩 My Contributions

During the group project, I was responsible for developing and implementing several key sections of the app:

- 🔹 **All Products Page** – Designed layout, pagination, integrated filtering logic, and made it fully responsive.
- 🔹 **Product Details Page** – Created dynamic route view with complete product data display and user interaction.
- 🔹 **Login & Registration Pages** – Built the forms with proper validation and integrated with backend auth.
- 🔹 **Home Page Sections** – Developed hero section, featured collections, and additional promotional content areas.
- 🔹 **Navbar** – Created a responsive, sticky navbar with navigation links and dynamic scroll behavior.

After the group project, I also cloned the repo and focused on **UI/UX enhancements**—aiming for a sleek, clean, and professional design.
